From the beginning, where I was here, this game was in 1000x600px frame. There was menu at the top, chat (removed), description under game (added hmm&amp;hellip; about 2 years ago?) and footer with copyright and links. Yesterday I came back here and I see that game fills whole page. I was even surprised that game menu showed quickly.</description></item></channel></rss>
