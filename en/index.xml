From the beginning, where I was here, this game was in 1000x600px frame. There was menu at the top, chat (removed), description under game (added hmm&amp;hellip; about 2 years ago?) and footer with copyright and links. Yesterday I came back here and I see that game fills whole page. I was even surprised that game menu showed quickly.</description></item><item><title>My first post</title><link>/en/posts/my-first-post/</link><pubDate>Tue, 28 Feb 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/en/posts/my-first-post/</guid><description>This is my first post on my blog. I will write my posts first in Polish, and then I will try to translate them into English no longer than 2 days after writing the Polish version (there may be few exceptions of this). Of course, my English may not be very good and completely understandable, so if you find a sentence whose meaning is completely different from that in Polish or you simply don&amp;rsquo;t understand it, please write me about it.</description></item></channel></rss>
