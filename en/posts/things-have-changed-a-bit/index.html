From the beginning, where I was here, this game was in 1000x600px frame. There was menu at the top, chat (removed), description under game (added hmm&mldr; about 2 years ago?) and footer with copyright and links. Yesterday I came back here and I see that game fills whole page. I was even surprised that game menu showed quickly. Quicker than I would have excepted. That I can almost immediately select server for playing. Or check if my maps are still here.</p><p>A while later, I noticed that four peoples want to add me to &ldquo;friends&rdquo;. So I added them. Shit, I have never seen them, nor other 218 of them that never seen me either. I recognize some of them, I even have written to, but they are minority.</p><p>Then I looked to my topic and found out that there were few game bugs noticed only on my map with island and already fixed. Two peoples complained that there are no map with four cubes, which I disabled earlier (along with two others) because it didn&rsquo;t meet the new requirements both Warmerise and mine.</p><p>Later I read the topic where someone complained that there were no MRNOOB&rsquo;s maps. From the second post I first read only that these maps were disabled because they didn&rsquo;t meet requirements. I thought myself - what the fuck? If his maps aren&rsquo;t there because they don&rsquo;t meet the requirements, what are my old maps doing untouched since years, including TheIsland2 last updated in 2018? I read further, and here Max wrote that he didn&rsquo;t deleted these maps. Then I returned to second post and read that maps author deleted these maps himself because he lost files with projects of maps he was creating. And everything became clear.</p></div><div class=blog__tags><a href=../../tags/warmerise>#warmerise</a>
