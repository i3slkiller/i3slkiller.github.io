This is my first post on my blog. I will write my posts first in Polish, and then I will try to translate them into English no longer than 2 days after writing the Polish version (there may be few exceptions of this). Of course, my English may not be very good and completely understandable, so if you find a sentence whose meaning is completely different from that in Polish or you simply don't understand it, please write me about it.

The topic of this blog isn't clearly defined. I will write on it what I want, how I want and when I want. I'm not going to write about something I don't want to write just because you want to read about it. I'm also not going to delete or castrate my texts just because it offends you, or because it's politically incorrect or even more so because you want it that way, and you don't care about the rest. I don't read other people's texts which I don't like, and somehow I don't complain about them wanting to write them², so if you don't like my texts, don't read them at all².

I won't try to make my texts easy to find. I don't care about famous peoples talking about my site or everyone reading it. If 2-3 peoples finds my site and will read it (I don't even have to know about it), it's fine and that's enough for me.

² if author/me don't care about antagonizing entire masses/groups of people who read his/my texts (delete as appropriate)
